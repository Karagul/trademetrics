Description: Provides a collection of trading performance measures, including
    return measures, risk measures, risk-adjusted return measures, and indicators
    for other purposes. These measures are implemented without heavy dependencies
    and thus work with high performance, which can be time-efficient in
    batch computing with massive trading/backtest data.
